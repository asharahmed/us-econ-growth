![alt text](https://github.com/asharahmed/us_econ_growth/blob/master/figures/ss.png?raw=true)

This project simulates the annual percentage change in US GDP over time using historical data and a normal distribution. The simulation can be used to estimate the likelihood of a future recession or economic growth.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/us_econ_growth.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd us_econ_growth`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the script: `python main.py`
2. The script will output two plots. The first plot shows the historical GDP growth rate from 1947 to 2100. The second plot shows the simulated GDP growth rate for the next 80 years.
